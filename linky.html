    <p>Quokkas are small macropods, which is a type of marsupial that only eats plants. They can weigh between 5.5 to 11 lb and are characterized by their stocky build and well developed hind legs, considering their small size. They are also known to have a “promiscuous mating system”. Their babies, called joeys, rely on their mothers’ milk while being in the pouch for six months as well as the two months after leaving the pouch. If a female quokka is chased by a predator while carrying a joey in her pouch, she may drop the baby on the ground and use the joey as a distraction as she escapes.</p>
