    <h1>Favorite Food</h1>
    <p>I always have a hard time picking what my favorite foods are because I just love food and eating. But if I had to choose cuisine wise, I think my favorite cuisine is <strong>Italian cuisine</strong>. I love any pasta. There’s just something about the combination of sauce and cheese that tastes so good.</p> 
    <h2>My Top Cuisines</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Italian</li>
        <li>Mexican</li>
        <li>Vietnamese or Japanese</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Favorite Band</h1>
    <p>Similar to foods, I can never choose one favorite band or artist. I usually enjoy listening to any kind of pop music or alternative music. Although it’s always changing, some of my favorite artists currently include <em>Taylor Swift, Charlie Puth, Sabrina Carpenter, and The Weeknd</em>.</p>
    <h2>List of Favorite Artists</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Taylor Swift</li>
        <li>Charlie Puth</li>
        <li>Sabrina Carpenter</li>
