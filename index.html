    <h1>Hello, English 388</h1>
    <p>My name is Selena! I am currently a senior, studying physiology. I've never coded like this before so this activity is very interesting. Some fun facts about me is that I enjoy crocheting in my free time. I've been crocheting for over a year and a half. It was one of the many activities I discovered during the pandemic. Over the pandemic, I also learned how to play the ukelele and guitar. Music has always played a huge part in my life so picking these instruments up was pretty easy to get the hang of. I even formed a band with my sister and cousins. We've only really performed in front of family but maybe one day we'll book a real gig.</p>
